# Assignment 2

### 1) Part 1: CV Webpage
Using HTML and CSS, I made a simple CV webpage. I referred to: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp to help with my webpage layout, specifically on how to clear floats after the columns.

### 2) Part 2: Elm App
Using Elm, I created a simple jumping game.
* Objective: Jump over the moving square and don't get hit.
* Controls: Press space key to jump.
* After each successful jump, the player gets a point. The obstacle will gradually increase in speed as the player scores points. If the player collides with the obstacle, it's gameover.
